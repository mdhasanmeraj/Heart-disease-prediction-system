The Heart Disease Prediction System is a machine learning-based application developed to 
assist in the early detection of heart disease. By analyzing patient data such as age, cholesterol 
levels, resting blood pressure, and other critical health indicators, the system predicts the 
likelihood of a person having heart disease. A classification model trained on a medical dataset 
forms the core of this predictive engine. The user-friendly web interface allows individuals to 
input their health parameters and receive an instant prediction. Built using Python and ML 
libraries like scikit-learn, this system can serve as a valuable support tool for healthcare 
professionals and patients, promoting timely diagnosis and improving health outcomes through 
technology-driven solutions.
